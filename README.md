# MIE1517HW2---Advanced-CNN-Transfer-Learning
Focused on practical performance improvement using modern deep learning techniques.
1. Implemented a deeper CNN architecture and compared it against baseline models.
2. Applied data augmentation & regularization techniques to improve generalization.
3. Introduced transfer learning with a pretrained model (e.g., ResNet/VGG) for a performance boost.
4. Evaluated results across train vs. validation accuracy, confusion matrix, and inference insight.
